The MATLAB code in this folder was written to 

- visualise the head movement during the recordings -> head_movement.m

and to 

- visualise for each session and subject the word onset locked event-related response at
the source-level. This script requires the source-level results to have been computed, as
per the dm_extractwords function in ../pipeline/meg  -> plot_tlck2.m
